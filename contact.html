      This cake was for my Mother’s 75th Birthday party. It was absolutely perfect!! Guests at the party were raving about how beautiful it was. Then, once the cake was cut and everybody started eating, people could not stop talking about how delicious it was! Everyone wanted to know where we got it. It was yellow cake with cannoli filling and it was to die for. The cake was SO moist and the cannoli filling was amazing. I will definitely be ordering from Dream Cakes again! Thank you!!

      <span class="review-title">"Lovely staff and yummy cake!"</span> <br>
      My daughter-in-law found a photo that was similar to her vision of the cake/cupcakes she wanted for her recent Baby Shower. Dream Cakes told me that could make them exactly as she desired. I picked up the order last week. It was exactly as promised, was ready on time, and the cake/cupcakes were fresh and delicious. The guests raved about them. Thanks so much ladies
